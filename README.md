## Project Background

Idea4U is an idea management website designed for UCL and NHS. It aims to provide a web-based idea-crowd-sourcing application that allows external stakeholders to interact with the challenges that UCL/NHS trying to solve.

Thus, we have developed an idea portal to crowdsource and curate ideas from users that are authenticated and authorised using sso.

- User can submit ideas to active challenges or submit open-ended idea
- Moderators of organisation can set challenges and criterias to source problem solutions
- Save idea/challenge contents as drafts to be completed later
- View all ideas and challenges in their respective dashboards
- Filter and sort ideas/challenges based on date, tags and popularity
- Voting system for user to vote for ideas they support
- Comment under ideas to discuss and exchange information about ideas
- Challenge creator can further evaluate suitability of chosen ideas by scoring them based on set criterias
- Moderator can approve ideas before they are published to ensure no inappropriate contents are posted
- Tags can be defined to classify ideas and challenges into categories
- Subscribe to challenges and view them in profile page
- Leaderboard and point system to encourage user engagement with portal
- Notification system to notify users when someone engages with their idea/challenge
- Authenticate with UCL sso , google or facebook account
- Each user have their own profile page to display and update personal information.
